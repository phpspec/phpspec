Running phpspec
===============

The phpspec console command uses Symfony's console component. This means
that it inherits the `default Symfony console command and options <http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/usage.html>`_.

**phpspec** has an additional global option to let you specify a config file
other than `phpspec.yml` or `phpspec.yml.dist`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --config path/to/different-phpspec.yml

or:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run -c path/to/different-phpspec.yml

Read more about this in the :doc:`Configuration Cookbook </cookbook/configuration>`

Also of note is that using the ``--no-interaction`` option means that no
code generation will be done.


**phpspec** has the global option to let you specify a custom bootstrap or autoloading script.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --bootstrap=path/to/different-bootstrap.php

or:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run -b path/to/different-bootstrap.php

Describe Command
----------------

The ``describe`` command creates a specification for a class:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec describe ClassName

Will generate a specification ClassNameSpec in the spec directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec describe Namespace/ClassName

Will generate a namespaced specification Namespace\ClassNameSpec.
Note that ``/`` is used as the separator. To use ``\`` it must be quoted:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec describe "Namespace\ClassName"

The ``describe`` command has no additional options. It will create a spec class in the `spec`
directory. To configure a different path to the specs you can use :ref:`suites <configuration-suites>`
in the configuration file.

Run Command
-----------

The ``run`` command runs the specs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run

Will run all the specs in the `spec` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run spec/ClassNameSpec.php

Will run only the ClassNameSpec.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run spec/ClassNameSpec.php:56

Will run only specification defined in the ClassNameSpec on line 56.

You can run just the specs in a directory with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run spec/Markdown

Which will run any specs found in `spec/Markdown` and its subdirectories.
Note that it is the spec location and not namespaces that are used to decide which
specs to run. Any spec which has a namespace which does not match its file path
will be ignored.

By default, you will be asked whether missing methods and classes should
be generated. You can suppress these prompts and automatically choose not
to generate code with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --no-code-generation

You can choose to stop on failure and avoid running the remaining
specs with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --stop-on-failure

TDD work cycle can be described using three steps: Fail, Pass, Refactor.
If you create a failing spec for a new method, the next step will be to make it pass.
The easiest way to achieve it, is to simply hard code the method, so it returns the expected value.

**phpspec** can do that for you.

You can opt to automatically fake return values with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --fake

You can choose the output format with the ``--format`` option e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/phpspec run --format=dot

The formatters available by default are:

* progress (default)
* html
* pretty
* junit
* dot

More formatters can be added by :doc:`extensions</cookbook/extensions>`.
