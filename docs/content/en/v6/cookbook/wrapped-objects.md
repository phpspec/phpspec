title: "Working with Wrapped Objects"

**phpspec** wraps some of the objects used in specs. For example `$this`
is the object you are describing wrapped in a phpspec object. This is
how you can call methods on `$this` and then call matchers on the
returned values.

Most of the time this is not something you need to worry about but
sometimes it can be an issue.

If you ever need to get the actual object then you can by calling
`$this->getWrappedObject()`.

If you try to specify a method on your object that starts with “should”,
for example:

```php
function it_should_handle_something($somethingToHandle)
{
    $this->shouldHandle($somethingToHandle);
}
```

Then this will not work as expected because **phpspec** will intercept
the call thinking it is a matcher. You can avoid this by using
`callOnWrappedObject`:

```php
function it_should_handle_something($somethingToHandle)
{
    $this->callOnWrappedObject('shouldHandle', array($somethingToHandle));
}
```
