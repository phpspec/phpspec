SpecBDD with phpspec
---------------------

**phpspec** is a tool which can help you write clean and working PHP
code using behaviour driven development or BDD. BDD is a technique
derived from test-first development.

BDD is a technique used at story level and spec level. **phpspec** is a
tool for use at the spec level or SpecBDD. The technique is to first use
a tool like **phpspec** to describe the behaviour of an object you are
about to write. Next you write just enough code to meet that
specification and finally you refactor this code.

SpecBDD and TDD
---------------

There is no real difference between SpecBDD and TDD. The value of using
an xSpec tool instead of a regular xUnit tool for TDD is **the
language**. The early adopters of TDD focused on behaviour and design of
code. Over time the focus has shifted towards verification and
structure. BDD aims to shift the focus back by removing the language of
testing. The concepts and features of the tool will keep your focus on
the "right" things.

SpecBDD and StoryBDD
--------------------

StoryBDD tools like [Behat](http://behat.org) help to understand and
clarify the domain. They help specify feature narratives, their needs,
and what we mean by them. With SpecBDD we are only focused on the how,
in other words, the implementation. You are specifying how your classes
will achieve those features.

Only using story level BDD will not do enough to help you write the code
for the features well. Each feature is likely to need quite a lot of
code. If you only confirm that the whole feature works and also only
refactor at that point then you are working in large steps. SpecBDD
tools guide you in the process by letting you write the code in small
steps. You only need to write the spec and then the code for the next
small part you want to work on and not the whole feature.

StoryBDD and SpecBDD used together are an effective way to achieve
customer-focused software.
