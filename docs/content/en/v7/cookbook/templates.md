**phpspec** can generate code snippets that will save you time when
specifying classes. The default templates will be suitable for many use
cases.

However in some cases, it'll be useful to customize those templates by
providing ones that suit your project requirements. For example, you may
need to add licence information in a docblock to every class file.
Instead of doing this manually you can modify the template so it is
already in the generated file.

Overriding templates
--------------------

**phpspec** uses three templates:

- *specification* - used when a spec is generated using the
  describe command
- *class* - used to generate a class that is specified but which
  does not exist
- *method* - used to add a method that is specified to a class

You can override these on a per project basis by creating a template
file in .phpspec in the root directory of the project. For example, to
add licence information to the docblock for a class, you can create a
file `{project_directory}/.phpspec/class.tpl`. You can copy the contents
of the default template found in **phpspec** at
`src/PhpSpec/CodeGenerator/Generator/templates/class.template` and add
the docblock to it:

```php
<?php

/*
 * This file is part of Acme.
 *
 * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE
 * file that was distributed with this source code.
 */%namespace_block%

class %name%
{
}
```

So now, for example, you want to describe a class `Acme\Model\Foo` which
does not exist. You can run the spec `spec/Acme/Model/FooSpec.php` and
let **phpspec** generate the missing class. **phpspec** will use your
overridden template and the generated file will look like:

```php
<?php

/*
 * This file is part of Acme.
 *
 * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE
 * file that was distributed with this source code.
 */

namespace Acme\Model;

class Foo
{
}
```

You can also override the templates for all your projects by creating a
template in .phpspec in your home directory.

**phpspec** uses the first template it finds by looking in this order:

1.  `{project_directory}/.phpspec/{template_name}.tpl`
2.  `{home_directory}/.phpspec/{template_name}.tpl`
3.  The default template

Parameters
----------

As well as static text there are some parameters available like the
`%namespace_block%` in the example above. The parameters available
depend on which type of template you are overriding:

**specification**

- `%filepath%` the file path of the class
- `%imports%` the alphabetically sorted imports
- `%name%` the specification name
- `%namespace%` the specification namespace
- `%subject%` the fully-qualified name of the class being
  specified
- `%subject_class%` the name of the class being specified

**class**

- `%filepath%` the file path of the class
- `%name%` the class name
- `%namespace%` the class namespace
- `%namespace_block%` the formatted class namespace

**method**

- `%name%` the method name
- `%arguments%` the method arguments
