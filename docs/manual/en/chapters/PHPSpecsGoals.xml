  <title>PHPSpec's Goals</title>

  <section id="goals">
    <title>Goals!</title>

    <para>As we've seen PHPSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development framework
    which allows you to write code examples which can be executed time and
    time again. It also supports the practice of BDD by focusing its API on a
    readable Domain Specific Language modelled after Plain English.</para>

    <para>What goals does PHPSpec seek to fulfill?</para>

    <variablelist spacing="normal">
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Focus attention on specifying behaviour instead of
        testing</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Behaviour-Driven Development is all about behaviour. How any
          class behaves can only be described accurately and efficiently by
          referring to its public interface and properties, its goals and
          specifications, its purpose in existing. In designing better code,
          writing examples of behaviour before implementing the code has
          proven a successful methodology.</para>

        <term>Offer a readable intuitive language for writing
        specifications</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>An example is worth a thousand words, especially if the code
          it's written in is readable by a non-programmer. By offering a
          fluent interface API closely approximating grammatically correct
          English we make examples even more valuable. This "domain specific
          language" reduces the cost of translating between the natural
          language with which we think, and the syntax of PHP.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Support the goals of Behaviour-Driven Development</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Behaviour-Driven Development is a progressive method of
          practising the true requirements of Test-Driven Development and
          avoids the common pitfalls that has made TDD difficult to adopt by
          many programmers. It shifts the focus from a viewpoint of Testing to
          the more valuable viewpoint of Specifying Behaviour. The change in
          language is accompanied by a shift in how we combine elements of TDD
          with Domain-Driven Design, Acceptance-Testing Driven Design and the
          concepts of User Stories and Scenarios.</para>

        <term>Easy to learn, comprehend and implement</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Although PHPSpec is formulated as a framework to support
          Behaviour-Driven Development it is not monumentally different from
          existing Unit Testing frameworks. Its execution and reporting is
          similar to most xUnit style frameworks in any language. Its API is
          deliberately modelled on plain English and is easy to
          comprehend.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Work with the developer, not against</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>PHPSpec is derived from existing BDD frameworks for Java,
          Smalltalk, .NET and Ruby. Its syntax borrows from these sources
          with a dash of PHP uniqueness. We endeavour to keep the framework as
          simple and flexible as possible. If it's not, we encourage you to
          complain long and hard!</para>

        <term>Support practising BDD in an Agile/XP setting</term>

        <listitem>
            <para>BDD is derived from several Agile and Extreme Programming
            practices. PHPSpec is more limited given its relative youth but
            supporting features from Mock Objects (via Mockery) to mainstream
            Framework integration is already happening. For User story writing
            and scenario specification, PHPSpec can used in conjunction with
            Behat.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>PHPSpec operates from the command line using the phpspec
          command. Its operation is inspired by the simplicity of PEAR QA's
          phpt execution. We'll expand the command line features over time as
          required by the user base.</para>

            <para>A near essential tool for any Ruby developer is the fabulous
            Autotest. Expect a PHP clone to emerge in the near future. For the
