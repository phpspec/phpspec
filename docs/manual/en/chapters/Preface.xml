	  <para>It was 2006 when I decided to learn the Ruby language (a fact that
	  probably isn't the best start to a PHP focused book but hey, it's where this
	  all started!). Around that time an alternative to using xUnit libraries for
	  Test-Driven Development (TDD) had emerged and was receiving a lot of
	  attention. Not one to turn down the tools available I installed the RSpec
	  framework and was introduced to the concept of Behaviour-Driven Development
	  (BDD), an evolution or repackaging of TDD whose focus was largely about
	  creating a new language to replace the traditional TDD terminology which was
	  focused on testing.</para>

	  <para>To my surprise, I found BDD fascinating. It made all the objectives of
	  TDD simpler to grasp and understand and my productivity using TDD properly
	  was a lot higher. It is not an easy concept to explain but BDD made TDD
	  easier and more enjoyable. For me, since I write code these days in my spare
	  time a lot, an enjoyable process was very much preferred.</para>

	  <para>Forward to 2007, and I found myself still preferring to use PHP. Ruby
	  is a very nice language but most of my interests were better served by a
	  language I had years of experience using. I was simply more productive using
	  PHP, I enjoyed it's sense of community, and I admit I had a Java-esque
	  affection for its syntax. Of course, I ran into one problem - PHP has no
	  RSpec-like framework. Say what you like about Ruby, but its community has an
	  annoying habit of introducing new practices and tools a lot faster than PHP
	  ever has.</para>

	  <para>So, after returning to PHP, I found no direct BDD support. I could
	  have simply molded my SimpleTest practices to a similar approach but it
	  would have barely been a half-measure. I wanted an RSpec like tool. I wanted
	  the ZenTest Autotest with it's utterly addictive Snarl or KDE Notify popups.
	  And I wanted it without catering to the expectations of xUnit frameworks.
	  And so, in October 2007, after a few discussions with community members like
	  Travis Swicegood, I became determined to just go and write one for PHP
	  rather than sit around bemoaning it's loss.</para>

	  <para>PHPSpec is the result of this effort. A Behaviour-Driven Development
	  (BDD) framework for PHP5.</para>

		<para>This book is intended for those who have an interest in applying
		Test-Driven Development or Behaviour-Driven Development since both have
		identical aims, and BDD is largely an attempt to improve the quality of
		practicing TDD. This book assumes you are at least familiar with the
		features, syntax and practice of PHP5 or any similar language especially
		in an object-oriented setting. No prior experience with either Unit
		Testing, TDD or BDD is required. We have included an introduction to the
		concept of Behaviour-Driven Development up front as Chapter 1.</para>

		<para>PHPSpec was designed for PHP5, specifically any version above PHP 5.3.3.
        It will not work with PHP 5.2 and below.</para>
