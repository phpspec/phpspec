  <para>PHPSpec should be installed using the PEAR Installer. PEAR (PHP
  Extension and Application Respository) is a simple, easy to use mechanism
  for distributing and managing PEAR packages. If you have PHP installed,
  chances are you already have a PEAR system ready to be utilised.</para>

    <title>Installing PHPSpec with PEAR</title>

    <para>PHPSpec is distributed primarily from its own dedicated PEAR
    channel. The PEAR Channel system is quite simple to use and eases the
    installation of PHPSpec in any scenario where you have access to your own
    PEAR installation. Before commencing an installation, you first need to
    "discover" the PHPSpec channel using the command:</para>

    <screen>sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpspec.net</screen>

    <para>The newly discovered channel will have its details stored by
    PEAR.</para>

    <para>To install the package simply execute the following command:</para>

    <screen>sudo pear install phpspec/PHPSpec</screen>

    <note>
      <para>Development snapshots of PHPSpec are regularly updated in the
        develop branch at <ulink url="http://github.com/phpspec/phpspec">
        http://github.com/phpspec/phpspec</ulink>. These snapshots are
        considered of dubious stability and should only be utilised for testing
        and feedback purposes. The installation of development snapshots is
        described in the "Installing PHPSpec Manually" section below.</para>

    <title>Installing PHPSpec from a PEAR download</title>

    <para>To install PHPSpec without using the PEAR channel system you can
    select a download of the PEAR archive from <ulink
    url="http://pear.phpspec.net/get">http://pear.phpspec.net/get</ulink> and
    by running the following command:</para>

    <screen>sudo pear install PHPSpec-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz</screen>

    <title>Installing PHPSpec Manually</title>

    <para>To install PHPSpec manually, you can use the non-Pearified tarball
    called "PHPSpec-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz" available for download from <ulink
    url="http://pear.phpspec.net/get/nonpear">
    http://pear.phpspec.net/get/nonpear</ulink>. Extract to your preferred
    location, and add the "src" directory to your php.ini include_path. You
    will also need to copy the phpspec script for your system (*.bat refers to
    a Windows friendly version) from the "scripts" directory to a location on
    your system PATH. This script must be edited to provide the location of the
    PHP binary executable as well as the path to the PHPSpec class files.
