Installation
============

**phpspec** is a php 5.6+ library that you'll have in your project
development environment. Before you begin, ensure that you have
PHP 5.6 or 7 installed.

Installation process:
---------------------

You can install phpspec with all its dependencies through Composer. Follow
instructions on `the composer website <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`_ if
you don't have it installed yet.

N.b.: You will need to ensure that your Composer ``autoload`` settings are
correct. phpspec will not be able to detect classes, even ones it has created,
unless this is working. This is a common issue which causes confusion when
installing phpspec.

The ``autoload`` section of your ``composer.json`` file may look something like
this:

.. code-block:: json

    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "": "src/"
        }
    }

Method #1 (Composer command):
-----------------------------

You can use this Composer command to install phpspec:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require --dev phpspec/phpspec

Method #2 (Composer config file):
---------------------------------

If you prefer editing your ``composer.json`` file manually, add phpspec to your
``require-dev`` section like this:

.. code-block:: js

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phpspec/phpspec": "[your preferred version]"
        },
        "config": {
            "bin-dir": "bin"
        },
        "autoload": {
            "psr-0": {
                "": "src/"
            }
        }
    }

Then install phpspec with the composer install command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer install

Result:
-------

phpspec with its dependencies will be installed inside the ``vendor`` folder.
The phpspec executable will be available at ``vendor/bin/phpspec``, or wherever
you have specified in your ``composer.json`` file's ``bin-dir`` setting.  See
the `composer docs <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#bin>`_ for more
information
