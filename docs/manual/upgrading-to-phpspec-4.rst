Upgrading to PhpSpec 4
======================

Here is a guide to upgrading a test suite or an extension, based on BC-breaking changes made in phpspec 4.

Upgrading for Users
-------------------

If you are using 3rd party **phpspec** extensions, you may have to increase the version numbers for those as well.

As PHP 5 is no longer supported language versions, you will need to upgrade to PHP 7 to use **phpspec** 4.

Most methods in PhpSpec now have static type hints and return types, this will affect you when you are overriding
behaviour from a parent class or implementing an interface.

If you are providing inline matchers in your specs you will need to provide the array type hint:

.. code-block:: php

    function getMatchers()
    {
        // return some matchers
    }

Change to:

.. code-block:: php

    function getMatchers() : array
    {
        // return some matchers
    }

If you are providing custom matchers, you will need to conform to the type hint changes in the Matcher interface.

Upgrading for Extension Authors
-------------------------------

Many PhpSpec interfaces and internal classes have had scalar typehints and return typehinting added.  You will need to
update your implementations of these interfaces to the new method signature.
