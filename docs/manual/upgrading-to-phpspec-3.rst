Upgrading to phpspec 3
======================

Here is a guide to upgrading a test suite or an extension, based on BC-breaking
changes made in phpspec 3.

Upgrading for Users
-------------------

If you are using 3rd party **phpspec** extensions, you may have to increase the
version numbers for those as well.

As PHP 5.5 and below are no longer supported language versions, you will need
to upgrade to PHP 5.6 or 7.0+ to use **phpspec** 3.

Where you have used `@param` annotations for spec examples, to indicate the
required type for a collaborator, you will need to remove these and use
explicit typehinting in the method signature instead. For example:

.. code-block:: php

    /**
     * @param \stdClass $collaborator
     */
    function it_does_something_with_a_stdclass($collaborator)

Change to:

.. code-block:: php

    function it_does_something_with_a_stdclass(\stdClass $collaborator)

Extension configured in your ``phpspec.yml`` needs to be changed from:

.. code-block:: yml

    some_extension_config: foo

    extensions:
        - SomeExtension
        - SomeOtherExtension

To:

.. code-block:: yml

    extensions:
        SomeExtension:
            some_config: foo

        SomeOtherExtension: ~

Upgrading for Extension Authors
-------------------------------

Several interfaces have been renamed in **phpspec** 3.0.  Here is a quick guide to
changes you will need to make in your code.

- ``PhpSpec\Console\IO`` is now ``PhpSpec\Console\ConsoleIO``
- ``PhpSpec\IO\IOInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\IO\IO``
- ``PhpSpec\Locator\ResourceInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\Locator\Resource``
- ``PhpSpec\Locator\ResourceLocatorInterface`` is now
  ``PhpSpec\Locator\ResourceLocator``
- ``PhpSpec\Formatter\Presenter\PresenterInterface`` is now
  ``PhpSpec\Formatter\Presenter\Presenter``
- ``PhpSpec\CodeGenerator\Generator\GeneratorInterface`` is now
  ``PhpSpec\CodeGenerator\Generator\Generator``
- ``PhpSpec\Extension\ExtensionInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\Extension``
- ``Phpspec\CodeAnalysis\AccessInspectorInterface`` is now ``Phpspec\CodeAnalysis\AccessInspector``
- ``Phpspec\Event\EventInterface`` is now ``Phpspec\Event\PhpSpecEvent``
- ``PhpSpec\Formatter\Presenter\Differ\EngineInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\Formatter\Presenter\Differ\DifferEngine``
- ``PhpSpec\Matcher\MatcherInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\Matcher\Matcher``
- ``PhpSpec\Matcher\MatchersProviderInterface`` is now ``PhpSpec\Matcher\MatchersProvider``

Some methods have a different signature:

- ``PhpSpec\CodeGenerator\Generator\PromptingGenerator#__construct``'s third and
  fourth arguments are now mandatory
- ``PhpSpec\Matcher\ThrowMatcher#__construct``'s third argument is now mandatory
- ``PhpSpec\Extension#load`` has now an additional mandatory ``array $params`` argument.

A few methods have been renamed in **phpspec** 3.0:

- ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer#set`` is now ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer#define``
- ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer#setShared`` is now ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer#define``

Other things to bear in mind:

- ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer`` is now an interface (available implementation:
  ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer\IndexedServiceContainer``)
- ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer\ServiceContainer#getByPrefix`` has been replaced by ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer\ServiceContainer#getByTag``. Tags can be set via ``PhpSpec\ServiceContainer\ServiceContainer#define``'s third argument
